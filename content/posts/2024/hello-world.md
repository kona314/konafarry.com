summary: I guess I have a blog now?
---

I first registered KonaFarry.com in early 2019. 

Since then, I've had effectively the same landing page for my name. The details of the content and layout changed a little over time, but on the whole it's been effectively the same page for nearly six years now. 

Strictly speaking, I could keep that up for the foreseeable future. In some ways I have: The root of this site is quite similar to the original version. 

However, sometimes a little change is a good thing. 

This new iteration, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), lays a foundation that gives me room to do a lot more with my website, when and if I need or want to. I now have individual (albeit currently very simple) pages for my [projects](/projects), and of course, can publish the occasional [post](/posts) if I've got something longform to say.[^1]

[^1]: Realistically, I don't see myself "blogging" very much, but it'll be nice to have this available if I want to.

I intentionally am not using a pre-built theme. They're pretty, but I wanted to have to learn this framework in detail, and I find that's best accomplished through having to work through all its parts. I'm also not a fan of all the bloat many themes and frameworks come with. This layout is clean and simpleâ€”that's all I need.
