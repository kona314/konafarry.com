I threw this iOS app together in March 2020, a time when we thought washing your hands would meaningfully combat the "novel coronavirus." It got a [shoutout in 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/13/hourly-reminders-to-wash-hands-on-iphone-apple-watch/).

This was also my first major foray into SwiftUI, which I use nearly exclusively today.
