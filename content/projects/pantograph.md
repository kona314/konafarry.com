Pantograph is my first and flagship project. Born in late 2018 during my junior year at the University of Washington, my initial intent was just to learn a little bit more about how transit operations planning works. 

In the process, I got a little carried away, taught myself to code, and released Pantograph in March 2019, then called the Puget Sound Transit Operations Tracker. It was featued in _The Seattle Times_, KING 5, GeekWire, and more.

It's evolved a lot since then: Pantograph tracks over 30,000 vehicles across more than 100 agencies now, and I'm currently in the midst of a total backend rewrite in [Swift](https://swift.org) (using the [Vapor framework](https://vapor.codes)) with all the benefits of sharper programming skills and more intentioned product direction.
