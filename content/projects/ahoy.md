I used to bank with [Simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_(bank)), an online-only bank I absolutely loved for their approach to managing money with Safe-to-Spend, goals, and more. 

After they got bought out and shut down, I built Ahoy, as there was nothing on the market that really did what I was looking for. This also came at a time in my life when I had a lot of free time, and it taught me a lot about technologies I hadn't worked with yet, like authentication and authorization. 

It's largely on ice now, but I still use it as my primary interface for money management.
