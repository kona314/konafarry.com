Hi, I'm Kona ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm interested in real-time transit data and improving the experience of using transit. I believe having high-quality tools is one critical step towards making transit easier and more enjoyable to ride, and that we must efficiently and effectively serve all members of our communities and build a more sustainable, more just, more mobile future.

I graduated from the University of Washington in June 2020 with a major in [Community, Environment, and Planning](https://cep.be.uw.edu/), and have worked at [Community Transit](https://communitytransit.org/) since October 2021, currently as the Business Analyst in Service Planning & Operational Design. 

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, visting local coffee roasters, taking transit leisure rides, and developing [Pantograph](https://www.pantographapp.com/), a powerful real-time tracker of over 30,000 transit vehicles from more than 100 agencies across North America.
